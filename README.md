# knn-rp

A very simple python implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors.

This script was made as an assignment for the Pattern Recognition course @ POLI, some parts of the code are in portuguese.

To run the code you'll need numpy and scipy (used for loading arff files). See requirements.txt.

Usage:
```
python knn.py
```
